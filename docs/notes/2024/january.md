## January 15, 2024

### Learning MkDocs
Today I discovered MkDocs and I'm amazed by how simple it is to create beautiful documentation sites. Just write Markdown and get a professional-looking website!

**Key benefits I found:**
- No need to learn CSS or HTML
- Beautiful Material theme out of the box
- Automatic navigation generation
- Built-in search functionality
- Mobile responsive design

### Technical Discovery
Found a great way to organize daily notes:
```
docs/
├── notes/
│   ├── 2024/
│   │   ├── january.md
│   │   ├── february.md
│   │   └── ...
│   └── 2025/
│       └── ...
```

!!! tip "Pro Tip"
    Use admonitions like this to highlight important information!
